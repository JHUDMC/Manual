### Lab Projector
The lab projector can be controlled by a remote on the column closest to the projector screen. There are two inputs on the projector, one for the wireless Crestron system which displays instructions on screen, and a direct HDMI connection that can be accessed by where the remotes are stored.

Any computer in the lab can connect to the projector using the [Crestron AirMedia](https://www.crestron.com/Software-Firmware/Software/Air-Media/AirMedia_OSx_Guest_Application/4-1-14) app.

To cast to the projector from a lab computer:
1. Open Crestron AirMedia (icon should be in the Dock)
2. Click "Ask Me" and then "OK" if you get a popup about "Session delegation options."
3. In the Connect screen, you'll see `AM-200-00107FFD4EEF - 10.166.42.218` listed. Click "Connect."
4. Enter in the AirMedia PIN code: `3817`.
5. Click the Control Center icon in the top right of the menu bar and select `Screen Mirroring`.
6. Select `AM-200-00107FFD4EEF` in the menu and enter the AirMedia PIN code again: `3817`.
7. You may need to press "source search" on the projector remote to get to the display.
8. No sound? Select `AM-200-00107FFD4EEF` as the audio output device in the system or specific application.

##### Step 2: "Show Me" Demo with DMC Staff
1. Make sure the Prusa and Raspberry Pi are powered on (Pi should never be turned off)
2. Load filament:
   - Autoload filament: push into top and select filament type on screen. Print head will start heating and pull filament in automatically.
   - Confirm that the material is extruding correctly from the print head.
3. Log into the shared dmc3D account on the computer by the 3D printers 
   - Username: dmc3D PW: dmc3Dpatron
4. Log into the OctoPrint web interface 
   - Username: dmc3D PW: dmc3Dpatron
   - There is a shortcut on the dmc3D account's desktop for each printer, or you can open [10.166.42.107](http://10.166.42.107) in a web browser (for Prusa 1) or [10.166.42.19](http://10.166.42.19) (for Prusa 2)
5. Check the connection to the printer in OctoPrint using the "Connection" module in the sidebar. If it is not connected, press "Connect."
6. Slice and send a print from PrusaSlicer to the OctoPrint server. Make sure the correct printer is selected in PrusaSlicer before slicing!
7. There's a little "G" with an arrow in the lower right hand corner of the PrusaSlicer Interface. This is the button to click.
8. Look at the webcam stream you can see anywhere on campus (or VPN into Hopkins)
 [bit.ly/dmcprusa1](http://bit.ly/dmcprusa1) and [bit.ly/dmcprusa2](http://bit.ly/dmcprusa2)
1.  Cancel the test print with OctoPrint and remove the first layer that started depositing on the build plate. Remove the steel sheet from the bed and twist it instead of scraping it off.
2.  Select "Unload filament" from the menu on the Prusa screen and properly secure the filament end in the spool.

## *Circulating Equipment Authorizations*

### Beginner DSLR Cameras

### Advanced DSLR Cameras

### Tripods
Every camera authorization must be accompanied by this tripod authorization if the patron is not already authorized to use the tripods!

#### Step 1: [Watch the Tripod video.](https://vimeo.com/231555948)

#### Step 2: "Show me" demo with DMC Staff

Safely attach a camera to a tripod using its quick release plate. 

***Make sure the camera and the mount plate are securely attached to the tripods and facing the correct direction on the mount.***

| Name                                | Recommended Applications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manfrotto 190X                      | This tripod is optimized for video, since it has a fluid head that allows for smooth camera motion. Can also be used for still photography but there are less bulky options suggested below.<br><br>**NOT for use with the Sony FS5, please use the Heavy Duty tripod instead** |
| Manfrotto Photo Tripod (with 3-Way) | This tripod is optimized for still photography, since it has an adjustable 3-axis head that provides a lot of freedom for camera placement (including portrait orientation).                                                                                                    |
| Pistol-Grip Ball Head               | This is our lightest tripod, useful for both photo and video. Has a ball head that allows for quick adjustments for photos, or relatively smooth camera movements for video.                                                                                                    |
| Manfrotto Heavy Duty Fluid Head     | This tripod is our heaviest, and is intended for use with heavy video cameras such as the Sony FS5. Not ideal for lighter cameras due to its weight and bulkiness.                                                                                                              |

### Lenses
The DMC has several speciality lenses you can attach to our camera kits (or use with your own Canon camera).

The Canon EF-series lenses are used with EOS DSLR cameras (T5i, 5D, and 1D cameras). R-series lenses are used with the full-frame mirrorless cameras (R6 and R8). The DMC's extra lenses are all EF but can be used with the R6 and R8 cameras. Adapter rings are in each of these camera kits.

#### Step 1: Check the chart for compatibility with the camera you want to use.

| Camera         | EF Lenses | EF-S Lenses |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Canon T5i      | Yes       | Yes         |
| Canon 1D Mk IV | Yes       | **No**      |
