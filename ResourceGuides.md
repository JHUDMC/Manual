##### Step 2: "Show Me" Demo with DMC Staff
1. Make sure the Prusa and Raspberry Pi are powered on (Pi should never be turned off)
2. Load filament:
   - Autoload filament: push into top and select filament type on screen. Print head will start heating and pull filament in automatically.
   - Confirm that the material is extruding correctly from the print head.
3. Log into the shared dmc3D account on the computer by the 3D printers 
   - Username: dmc3D PW: dmc3Dpatron
4. Log into the OctoPrint web interface 
   - Username: dmc3D PW: dmc3Dpatron
   - There is a shortcut on the dmc3D account's desktop for each printer, or you can open [10.166.42.107](http://10.166.42.107) in a web browser (for Prusa 1) or [10.166.42.19](http://10.166.42.19) (for Prusa 2)
5. Check the connection to the printer in OctoPrint using the "Connection" module in the sidebar. If it is not connected, press "Connect."
6. Slice and send a print from PrusaSlicer to the OctoPrint server. Make sure the correct printer is selected in PrusaSlicer before slicing!
7. There's a little "G" with an arrow in the lower right hand corner of the PrusaSlicer Interface. This is the button to click.
8. Look at the webcam stream you can see anywhere on campus (or VPN into Hopkins)

1.  Cancel the test print with OctoPrint and remove the first layer that started depositing on the build plate. Remove the steel sheet from the bed and twist it instead of scraping it off.
2.  Select "Unload filament" from the menu on the Prusa screen and properly secure the filament end in the spool.

### PA Systems
This authorization allows you to check out both the [Yamaha Stagepas](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/equipment/item/147953) and the [Samson Expedition](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/equipment/item/147967) portable PA systems. They function very similarly.

#### Step 1: [Watch the Yamaha PA video.](https://vimeo.com/195515763)
#### Step 2: "Show Me" demo with DMC Staff
1. **Unpack the kit, connect power and speaker cables.** Always lower the master volume when attaching/detaching cables or when powering on/off (to avoid loud POPS).
2. **Connect a microphone with an XLR cable** and a laptop or other small playback device with a 1/8" jack.
   - *Staff:* grab a vocal mic, XLR cable, and aux cable OR 1/8" TRS to 1/4" dual mono cable from the cage)
3. **Plug in** a playback device to a stereo channel, and the microphone into a mono channel. Play some music and speak into the microphone.
4. **Demonstrate adjusting levels**, both **input gain** (per channel) and **output volume** (master) 
5. *Staff:* show EQ adjustments per channel and effect/aux sends. (optional)
6. **Wrap all cables neatly** and **pack the kit back up.**
7. Recommend **speaker stands** for optimal sound quality. 

### Mixers
This authorization allows you to check out both the [Mackie 1202-VLZ Pro Mixer](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/equipment/item/146927) (analog) and the [Presonus AR12c Mixer](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/equipment/item/146930) (digital). The Presonus mixer also has built-in recording, digital effects, and more channels for auxiliary sends, but both mixers have the same basic functions.

1. **Plug in the mixer's power cable.**
2. **Always turn down the master volume** when attaching/detaching cables or when turning mixer on/off (to avoid POPS).
3. **Turn on** the mixer.
4. Point out **XLR** and **1/4" TRS inputs** (i.e. where to plug stuff in). 
5. Point out the **multiple outputs** (XLR and TRS), where to connect cables for **main speakers, monitors, and headphones.**
6. Point out **phantom power switch,** make sure they understand that some mics (condensers) require phantom power and some mics (dynamic) do not.
7. Explain input gain knobs for individual channels, the **individual channel output volume fader** and **master volume fader.**
8. Point out **EQ knobs** for each channel.
