# Lab Operations

## Facilities Overview

### The DMC lab
The DMC's main space comprises a computer lab with projector and television, 3D printers, laser printer, inkjet printers, maker counter, Project Space with a Cricut and sewing, and embroidery machine, an Audio Studio, VR and small video production studio, and an equipment checkout counter.

### Lab Computers and Specialty Stations
At the heart of the DMC is our computer lab featuring a variety of specialized Mac and PC workstations with a full complement of commercial and professional-grade software for completing tasks related to audio, video, photography, animation, 3D modeling, and graphic design for both web-based & multimedia projects. Check each computer's [BookIt listing](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/reserve/InLabComputers) for more information on its complement on software and extra peripherals.

### Equipment Cage

The cage is organized by similar types of equipment together. It’s important to put things back in the correct spot so if you’re unsure where something goes ask a coworker. All of our equipment has asset tags with location in the checkout system identified by “F” or “R” for Front or Rear cage room and then “N”, “E”, “S”, “W” for North, East, South, and West walls. 

### Audio Studio
This acoustically-treated studio is equipped with professional monitor speakers, a full-size digital piano with weighted keys, digital and analog synthesizers, guitars, a MIDI control surface, and a digital drum set. Combined with the circulating audio gear offered by the DMC, you can set up mics, instruments, turntable controllers — whatever you need to produce and mix your project.

The use of the studio requires authorization from a trained DMC staff member.

More information about the Audio Studio's hardware and software are on [BookIt](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/space/136534). 

### Project Space
The Project Space  houses tools for light fabrication and textile work, including a dressform, iron and ironing board, and digital embroiderer. A tool chest has several hand tools like screwdrivers, hammers, and miter box. 

The Project Space has a copy stand useful for stop-motion animation.

A Mac with Cricut Design Space, Clo3D, and other useful maker software allows you to "seamlessly" integrate 3D design with  physical creations.

### Multi-Use VR Space
Experience new adventures in the DMC VR Studio! Equipped with an HTC Vive Pro headset and two joysticks, you can pursue adventures in distant lands, slice through fruit with your samurai swords, and immerse yourself entirely in the world of gaming without a tether – as long as you remember which world is real! You can also invite your friends to join as they view your gameplay on the 50” screen – the more, the merrier.

In addition to immersive gaming, the VR Studio can be used for video or photo production (using the installed backdrops) special projects, meetings, and other creative uses that may require a controlled environment.

### Gaming Loft
The DMC manages the Gaming Loft in the southeast corner of The LaB, accessible from Charles Street under the green pergola above the DMC. The Gaming Loft is a handful of computers that students can use to play games whenever the LaB facility is open (which often differs from the DMC). It is open to all students. They are encouraged to [reserve time at the gaming stations using BookIt](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/reserve/GamingPCs).

### Storage Spaces
The DMC stores various items you will need to access for your job.
- **Front Desk:** The drawers and shelves around the front desk contain the DMC office supplies, hard copies of work guides, and most consumables for sale.
- **Maker Cabinets:** The maker cabinets are the cabinets below the maker counter in the lab. These cabinets contain the 3D printing filament, vinyl tools, and doodads for maker projects. 
- **Printer Paper Cabinets:** Below the Pharos print station is the regular printer paper of all sizes.

7. Check Discord for any new questions, comments, announcements, etc.
8. Complete work tasks as laid out in the [DMC hierarchy of needs.](StaffProtocols.md#The-DMC-Staff-Hierarchy-of-Needs)

### At the End of Your Shift
1.	Once the next staff member is there to relieve you, sign out of the `dmcadmin` account on the Front Desk computer to sign the previous staff member out of their accounts. **DO NOT LEAVE THE LAB IF NO ONE IS THERE TO TAKE OVER THE FRONT DESK** UNLESS YOU ARE CLOSING! If the next staffer does not arrive on time and you have to leave, please call Travis (804-901-6119) or Jason (913-302-1743). 
2.	Make sure the Master key is in the lock box in the top drawer of the front desk.
3.	Note the time you left for accurate reporting of your hours worked in TimesheetX.
4.	Put away your staff lanyard.

### Closing
If you cover the final shift of the day, you are responsible for closing the lab:
1.	Give routine warnings to patrons (30 minutes before close, 15 minutes before close, etc.) that "We'll be closing at __ o'clock; please start saving files, etc., as necessary." This includes anyone out in the Audio Studio, the VR Studio, and Project Space.
2.	Make sure the lab is empty and equipment that needs to be in the cage is secured.
3.	At 12:00 AM Midnight on Mon - Thursday and/or at 10:00 PM on Fri, Sat, & Sun, flip the signs from OPEN to CLOSED on both doors. Close the door to the vestibule and turn the thumb toggle lock.
4.	Look at each of the "overdue" items in BookIt:
- Is it actually overdue?
- If you find it on the shelf, was it 'returned' on the paper receipt?  If so, by whom? (That person will need to get a gentle reminder email about returning in BookIt as well as on paper.)
- If the item is on the shelf with paper check-in done, just "return" in BookIt and waive the late fine.
- If the item is on the shelf with no paper check-in, do paper check-in, return in BookIt, waive the late fine, and send digitalmedia@jhu.edu an email with details.
5.	Throw away any trash and move chairs to the correct places in the lab.
6.	Wash any dishes left in the break room sink. 
7.	Go around the lab and shut and lock all the doors, close blinds in the lab, and turn all the lights off – see the floor plan called "DMC Floor Plan Closing Shift" below to find the lights to turn off and doors to close and lock.
8.	Lock the master key back into the lock box in the top drawer of the front desk.
9.	Put away your staff lanyard.
10.	Turn open/close signs on both doors to "closed".
11.	Note the time you leave for TimesheetX!
12.	Leave out the back (south) door.

### Unexpected Closures
When the university closes due to bad weather or a dangerous situation, the DMC will be closed. Special accommodations (for equipment returns, grabbing items, etc.) will be granted at the discretion of Pro Staff.

If the University deems it unsafe for students to go outside this means you are not allowed in the DMC without special permission.  Once the 'all clear' has been communicated, you are expected to resume your regularly scheduled work shifts. Alerts will be communicated through university email, text messages, and on the alerts web page. https://www.jhu.edu/alert/   Please check your email for a message from DMC ProStaff confirming the University closure and any additional concerns.

## Equipment Checkouts
This guide refers to the physical process of handling checkouts and checkins. Refer to BookIt guides for more information on managing the software.

Checking cage equipment in and out is a core component of working at the DMC. It is the responsibility of the patron to check that every kit's components is present on the way out, and the responsibility of the DMC staff to check everything on the way in.

NOTE: Always try to show patrons how to find BookIt from our website and make a reservation themselves. This will ensure the proper authorizations are being followed and that they are getting what they need. 

### Checking Out Equipment
1.	Ensure that the patron has made a reservation themselves. If not, show them to the computer by the front door where they can make their own. 
2.	Use the Front Desk computer which has a special Chrome extension for BookIt. Under the Checkout tab, find the reservation by name and begin to grab the items from the cage and place them somewhere the patron can easily look through everything. 
3.	Once the correct items have been grabbed, or swapped, select the items and click Check Out. 
4.	A receipt PDF will pop up in a new tab. Print this.
5.	Notify the patron that it’s in their best interest to check the kit components off the list one by one, otherwise they will be responsible for any missing items that may have been missing when they checked it out. If there is something of note, tell the student to write it on the receipt. 
6.	Once they are done, ask them to sign it and return it where it goes into the checkout binder (sorted by last name of patron) until it is returned.

### Checking In Equipment
1.	Instruct the patron to put the items on the check-in table and open everything up for you.
2.	Inquire how everything worked, and if they had any problems with any of the gear.
3.	If there are any digital files associated with any of the gear, ask the patron if they have saved any files they might want/need.
4.	REMOVE the signed paper receipt from the binder, close the binder, and bring the paper receipt to the table to conduct the check-in.
5.	Complete a thorough check-in as required for each item.
6.	Actually LOOK for and HANDLE each item listed on the receipt (including memory cards and small components).
7.	Actually WRITE a checkmark on the receipt for EACH item on the list! Ideally, there will be room to do this in the right column of the receipt, but if there's not, just do it SOMEWHERE and put your initials nearby the checkmarks, hopefully in the same color, and maybe even with an arrow pointing towards them, to indicate to other staff members that it is indeed you.
8.	*Legibly* initial and date the receipt.
9.	Before doing anything else, put the paper receipt on the keyboard at the Front Desk so you DON'T FORGET to complete the return in BookIt.
10.	If the checkout is returned late, tell the patron that there is a fine and collect it. If you encounter any resistance, you can notify them of the One-Time Fine Waiver and put them in touch with ProStaff.
11.	If ANYTHING is lost or damaged, **WHILE THE PATRON IS STILL PRESENT,** take the time to conduct the CORRECT Repair and Replace procedures.
12.	At this point, if there are no problems tell the patron (politely) that they are free to go. New patrons will not know what the procedure is and loiter since they think there's something else that they need to do. Loitering patrons take up space in the lab and will add to the confusion. 
13.	Put the items in the correct location(s) in the cage and put ALL rechargeable batteries/items on the charger at the front counter.
14.	Check in the item from BookIt as soon as you return from the cage. You'll remember to do this because the paper receipt is still sitting on the keyboard because you put it there after these instructions coerced you into being so forward-thinking.
15.	Once the items are “returned” in BookIt, put the paper receipt in the back section of the binder.
16.	If there are still unreturned items on the receipt, please keep it in the “active” alphabetized part of the checkout binder.

---

During check-in/check-out of equipment, student staffers may not:
1.	Allow patrons to leave unattended equipment at the DMC after it is checked out to them.
2.	Allow patrons to leave parts of kits at the DMC while the kit is checked out to them.
3.	Waive fines of over 30 minutes without permission from DMC Pro Staff. 
4.	Allow patrons to leave before check-in of all their returned items is completed.
5.	Allow other patrons or friends to check out equipment for someone else’s booking.
6.	Allowing patrons to know who has a current or future reservation for an item. 
	
**Stu Staff must always check out equipment and workstations when using the lab themselves.** ***You may check out your own equipment, but another staff member must check in your equipment.***

### Roleplay Scenarios for Front Desk Check-Out/Check-In
Hypothetical interactions between patrons and staff (for staff training purposes).

#### Good Check-Out
A patron is borrowing a camera kit they’ve reserved ahead of time. Both they and the front desk employee do everything correctly: tap card to open the door when they arrive, say their name and what they’re picking up, the front desk worker goes to fetch it and print the receipt. The patron examines everything in the kit and checks off the boxes correctly. The microphone is missing and they circle it on the page and tell the front desk worker. The front desk worker consults BookIt and confirms that the kit is indeed missing a microphone. The receipt is hole-punched and put in the “active” section of the binder.

#### Bad Check-Out
The patron shows up more than 15 minutes after their booking time, so it expired in BookIt. They are upset and want the front desk employee to remake the booking for them. The employee directs them to the kiosk. The patron decides they want to book an advanced camera for which they are not authorized. The front desk employee points them to less advanced equipment and advises them to schedule an authorization with a pro staff member. When they get the camera kit and checklist, they start checking the boxes without looking through the kit parts. The front desk worker stops them and explains that checking through the kit protects them from liability for missing items so it’s in their best interest to check everything. The patron wants to leave a part of the kit behind they don’t need. The front desk employee explains that they must take the whole kit.

#### Good Check-In
The patron arrives early or on time with their item. The front desk employee finds their checkout sheet in the binder. They sort through the items and reference the sheet, making sure it’s all in good condition and the patron patiently waits. The employee thanks the patron and lets them know everything is in order. They hit “check-in” on the reservation in BookIt and move the paper receipt to the “complete” section of the binder.

#### Bad Check-In
The patron shows up ~45 minutes late for their reservation return. They are upset that there’s an un-waivable fine on their account. They ask if they can renew it. No, it’s already late. They try to get out of it by asking who has the camera reserved next. The employee explains they can’t give out that information, and how to set up the one-time fee waiver meeting with Pro Staff. In checking in the camera, the employee points out the SD card is missing. The patron says they must have left it at home, and agrees to run and get it while the employee holds the rest of the kit behind the counter (leaving the check-in on BookIt and the paper receipt incomplete until the patron returns).

---

### Renewals
Patrons must call our front desk to renew their equipment.

A patron can only renew a checkout if the item(s) in question are
- Not already overdue
- Still available (i.e. no other reservation immediately after theirs)
- Within 24 hours of the original due date.

- If the item(s) are not within 24 hours of the due date, the patron will have to wait until then to see if their items are renewable.

If a patron has multiple items on multiple bookings, make sure they renew each item separately.

Before renewing, check the Internal Notes on the item booking to see how many times it's been renewed.

Renewing items on BookIt:

### Overdue Items
It’s important to stay on top of overdue items before they affect future reservations for other patrons. On shift, please keep track of overdue items in BookIt and call patrons on the front desk phone with overdue items. If you can’t get in touch with them, shoot them an email using the dmcstaff@jhu.edu email account so all staff can monitor the response. 

You should log contact attempts on the “Internal Notes” in the “Booking Details” modal on BookIt. 

### Fines 

Late DMC items accrue fines at a rate of **$1 per hour per item** until the value of the equipment has been reached. Students will not be able to check anything out from the DMC until they have resolved their fines. 

- BookIt won’t cap fines at the value of the equipment, so you’ll be required to do the math yourself before you charge the student. Do not charge the student more than the value of the equipment (amount found in BookIt). 
- You can charge fines on the JCash reader using an input called “fines” or by using the credit card reader.
- Remember to clear the fine on the patron's account in BookIt!

#### Fine Waiver
The DMC offers students a one-time fine waiver for late fines only (not broken/missing equipment). If a student would like to use their waiver, they can email digitalmedia@jhu.edu. ProStaff will check their account and send them the waiver form on HopkinsGroups. 

### Missing and Broken Items
If an item comes back broken or missing components:

- Notify the student that Pro Staff will be in touch about the charge for repairing or replacing the item. 
- Can the item be easily replaced with circ room backstock? (for example, an SD card).
  - If so, replace the item and make a Circulation Ticket outlining what you took from the circ room and include the students’ JHED who lost the item so ProStaff can charge the appropriate amount to their account. Change the “Bucket” to “Charging Patrons/Financial” and assign it to a Pro Staff member. Note what you did in the item's Maintenance Log on BookIt.
  - If not, but the item is still usable without the component, make a Circulation Ticket and list the missing item in Damage Notes.
- If the missing or damaged item renders the entire kit unusable:
  - Set the item's status to "Offline" in BookIt so the missing/broken items don’t impact upcoming reservations. Put details in the “Damage Notes” field on the item.  Make a Circulation Ticket detailing the problem and assign it to the “Fixing” Bucket. Make sure the ticket also references the specific patron/reservation during which the item was lost or damaged so we can charge them appropriately.
  - If there are upcoming reservations, cancel them and notify the patrons of available alternatives via email. 
  - Place the item in the Circ Room on the ‘broken’ shelf.
