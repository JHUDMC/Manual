## Facilities Overview

### The DMC lab
The DMC's main space comprises a computer lab with projector and television, 3D printers, laser printer, inkjet printers, maker counter, Project Space with a Cricut and sewing, and embroidery machine, an Audio Studio, VR and small video production studio, and an equipment checkout counter.

### Lab Computers and Specialty Stations
At the heart of the DMC is our computer lab featuring a variety of specialized Mac and PC workstations with a full complement of commercial and professional-grade software for completing tasks related to audio, video, photography, animation, 3D modeling, and graphic design for both web-based & multimedia projects. Check each computer's [BookIt listing](https://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu/reserve/InLabComputers) for more information on its complement on software and extra peripherals.

### Equipment Cage

The cage is organized by similar types of equipment together. It’s important to put things back in the correct spot so if you’re unsure where something goes ask a coworker. All of our equipment has asset tags with location in the checkout system identified by “F” or “R” for Front or Rear cage room and then “N”, “E”, “S”, “W” for North, East, South, and West walls.
