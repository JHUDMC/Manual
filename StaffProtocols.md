# Staff Protocols

## Security
Student Staff are often the primary (and sometimes sole) safeguards of the resources and members of the DMC. You are expected to always use good judgment and monitor the lab and its users for potential hazards, such as unsafe equipment (cables in walkways) and unsafe behavior (unruly people who refuse to leave).

As our valued employees, however, we want you to place your own safety and welfare above all other concerns. To protect yourselves, lab members and DMC resources, please abide by the following practices:

1.	Keep the Cage and Circ Room doors closed during business hours.
2.	Do not allow non-staff behind the front desk or into other staff-only areas.
3.	Be alert to problematic behavior by patrons or visitors.
4.	Err on the side of caution when you feel uncomfortable, and call Public Safety's non-emergency line: 6-4600 from the Front Desk phone or 410-516-4600 on your cell phone.
5.	When leaving the lab after-hours, call Security for an escort or use the [LiveSafe smartphone app](https://publicsafety.jhu.edu/resources-services/livesafe-app/).

## Emergencies
- **In case of fire:** evacuate the building; call 410-516-7777 or 911 (JHU phone only)
- **Serious injuries:** call Public Safety's emergency line at 410-516-7777 or 911 (JHU phone only)

It is the policy of The Johns Hopkins University that all incidents which result in an injury to faculty, staff, students, or visitors shall be appropriately documented and reported using the following guidelines:

1.	All injuries occurring in the DMC, or to staff while working for the DMC shall be promptly reported to the Associate Director of the DMC.
2.	 All injuries to students shall be promptly reported to DMC Pro Staff **and** JHU Public Safety.
3.	In the event of an injury to a visitor, Security should be notified (6-4600). Security will call in HERU if needed for a medical assessment. 
4.	The staff member shall direct or assist the injured individual to the appropriate treatment area:
    - Students: Student Health Clinic, 3003 N. Charles Ste. 200 (31st street entrance) (410) 516-8270
    - Staff: Occupational Health Services, 3100 Wyman Park Drive, Room 670
5.	For employee incidents, the supervisor shall complete an "Incident Report" form and forward the form to the appropriate treatment area.

### Evacuation Procedures
Unless the staff has been notified via signs posted by campus security, all alarms are to be taken seriously. The following steps should be taken if alarms sound or smoke or fire are evident:
1. Walk around the lab, including the offices and editing suites, and (calmly but firmly) tell everyone to gather their things and quickly save their work; that they need to vacate because of the alarm.
2. If students do not comply after several attempts, inform them that their computer is being turned off. Shut down the computer.
3. Check to see that everyone has left. Make note of anyone who refuses to leave.
4. Turn off lights and close the door behind you. Report anyone still in the lab to emergency personnel.
5. Gather at the designated evacuation location and wait for further instruction. Officers may need to talk with you about the incident so do not leave the vicinity of the building until told to do so.

## Staff After-Hours Access
It is our policy to allow students access to the DMC after hours if the student is employed by the DMC and is a full-time student in good standing. 

Please note that extended access is intended as a courtesy to student staff and their collaborators to work on personal/academic projects and not intended as an after-hours recreational space. Staff are responsible for their collaborators while in the DMC after hours, and may not leave them alone in the lab at any time.

Student and professional staff understand that they may be alone in the building and that they are responsible for informing JHU Security (410-516-4600) of their presence in the DMC after hours.  It is also advised that DMC staff call Security to [request an escort](https://publicsafety.jhu.edu/resources-services/services-for-you/escort-program/) when leaving the lab after hours, or use the LiveSafe app. 

## Behavioral Policy
All users of the DMC (patrons), including students, faculty, staff, JHU affiliates and guests, are to follow the policies and procedures which govern the use of technology on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus. Please review these policies every year you are employed at the DMC: http://it.jhu.edu/policies

In addition to monitoring one’s own personal conduct and compliance with university email and copyright policies, it is necessary that you be aware of, and occasionally intervene in, our users’ actions while in the lab. If during your shift you notice a student violating DMC or University policy regarding personal behavior or use of JHU facilities, you will need to take the following steps:
1.	Inform the patron that users of the lab must abide by DMC and University policy, and explain what they are doing which is not allowed.
2.	If the patron needs clarification, direct them to the [University IT policies page](http://it.jhu.edu/policies)
3.	If the patron persists in unacceptable behavior, they must leave the lab. In this case, be sure to send an email to the DMC Pro Staff noting the patrons’ name, date and time of the infraction, and notes about what transpired. If you are having consistent problems, feel free to call a Pro Staffer on their cell. 
4.	If a patron has been asked to leave and will not cooperate, do not hesitate to call JHU Security to assist (6-4600).

Staff will undertake to ensure that all users of the lab comply with the lab rules and guidelines. These are the same rules to which members agree to by signing the member agreement when registering to use the DMC.

To maintain an atmosphere conducive to work for all students who use the DMC, we ask that everyone in the lab adhere to the following list of rules and guidelines.

1.	A valid JHU ID is required for admittance to the DMC. If they are not a JHU student or affiliate or accompanied by a JHU affiliate, please ask them to leave.
2.	Only enrolled students may use the lab facilities, borrow equipment, and purchase media/printing services. Only DMC Pro Staff have the discretion to make DMC resources available to anyone else, whether they are other students, staff or faculty. Refer non-eligible folks who wish to use DMC resources to digitalmedia@jhu.edu.
3.	No food or open containers of liquid are permitted in the Lab at any time. DMC staff may eat and drink in the break room, and only at the Front Desk if no other staff member is available to watch the lab. Closed drinks are permitted.
4.	Members should refrain from loud talking and use headphones when working with sound files or for recreational listening.
5.	Please make sure that people using video editing software are using headphones. 
6.	Patrons should not display on public screens images, sounds, or messages that could create an atmosphere of discomfort or harassment to others.
7.	Printing a large number of copies of a single document is not permitted. Use your discretion, but more than 25 copies or so is a good rule of thumb.
8.	Shirts and shoes are required at all times.
9.	Priority usage of DMC resources is given to the creation of student projects above gaming and other social purposes.
10.	Altering the established hardware configuration is prohibited.

## Confidentiality Policy
- No matter who someone says they are, or how bad a purported emergency is, never give out personal information about our patrons, student staff or professional staff.
- An appropriate answer to any plea is to offer to take a message. You may give out Pro Staff emails and offer to contact on-duty staff if the call is urgent. If the call seems legitimate, try to get more information that you can pass to a staff member.
- Student staff contact info is posted in various places around the lab for staff-only access (e.g., in the break room). Do not give out staff work times or contact information under any circumstance as it is a violation of their FERPA rights. 
- Patrons may arrange an appointment with a staffer via HopkinsGroups or email. 
- Patrons may not be informed of who else is reserving equipment or spaces that they are/would like to use. This is so that people get trained on our equipment so patrons cannot be bullied out of using the audio studio, cameras, or other resources. 
- If in doubt about whether you should share something, please consult a student manager or Pro Staff.

## DMC Member Agreement
All patrons of the DMC must fill a form acknowledging they agree to these agreeing to the policies below. Completing this form (and paying the membership fee, if applicable) allows them full access to DMC resources for the duration of their enrollment at Johns Hopkins-affiliated schools. This agreement also applies to student staff who use DMC resources.

# Core Aspects of Working at The DMC

## The DMC Staff Hierarchy of Needs

1.	Assist patrons at the front desk or on the phone.
2.	Provide equipment authorizations or one-on-one assistance with advanced technologies.
3.	Proactively assist patrons in the lab or complete routine front desk tasks.
4.	Complete a project or task that a Pro Staffer requests.
5.	Complete an ongoing project for your team as directed by a student manager.
6.	Complete needed tasks such as working on Circulation Tickets or creating social media posts. 
7.	Engage in self-paced technology training.
8.	Do homework or other non-DMC-related activities.

## Customer Service
Although it is easy to focus on the technical aspects of working at the DMC, the job of the DMC student staffer is largely one of customer service. The patrons using the equipment and facilities are our customers, and it is your job to see that their needs are being met, whether by assisting with technical questions, scheduling the use of space and equipment, referring members to additional resources, and keeping the lab running smoothly. To best perform this function, please keep in mind the following points:

- As a Student Affairs employee, your underlying mission is to assist the development of students. Promoting the intellectual, emotional, and ethical growth and development of JHU students is the reason we are here, whether faculty, staff, or even student employee.
- You are expected to be proactively monitoring the lab, using your best judgment to determine whether a patron needs assistance, even if they are not asking for help.

> **Effective communication is essential to the operation of the DMC. Using both the appropriate style and method of communication are important, as is knowing when and what to communicate.**

- If a patron comes into the lab asking for a specific staff member, it may be because they really need that person’s expertise, or it may just be because they happen to remember that person’s name, but *anyone* can help them. 
- When patrons have a question that you can’t answer, get the basic information of the situation and find out how to contact them. Then email the appropriate professional staff member or the general pro staff email at digitalmedia@jhu.edu. When appropriate, give the student a professional staff member’s business card for direct contact. You can also direct patrons to the professional staff photo cards on the cage wall. These contain general hours for staff members and contact information. They can also reserve a meeting directly using the HopkinsGroups scheduling tool.

#### When a Patron Arrives at the DMC:
1.	Greet them and ask how you can be of assistance.
2.	Ask questions (don't assume) to find out what they hope to do, so you can best assist them.
3.	Be sure to focus fully on the person in front of you.
4.	If multiple people are at the Front Desk waiting for assistance, try to acknowledge each one so they know you are aware of their presence and ask fellow on-duty DMC staff members for help.
5.	If they are at the DMC to use an in-lab resource like a computer or the Audio Studio, encourage them to make a reservation on BookIt and/or check-in on the site. 

#### When a Patron Leaves the DMC:
1.	Ask them if they had any equipment or workstations checked out; make sure these are returned in BookIt.
2.	Ask them if they had any trouble. You should be checking on this during the period that they were actually working, but it's good to follow up. Sometimes people admit at this point that they couldn’t figure something out, and you may need to refer them to the appropriate ProStaff.
3.	Tell them to have a great day. We want them to come back, so be nice!

### Answering the Phone

| DMC Main Phone Number       | (410) 516-3817 |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| DMC Pro Staff Office Number | (410) 516-0955 |

When you are on duty, you are responsible for answering the phone. Your voice will likely be the first contact with DMC for most people. Please use the following procedure when answering the phone, forwarding calls, or taking messages.

Always answer with: 
> **“Hi. This is _______ at the Digital Media Center, how may I help you?”**
- Answer any questions you can, but admit to the caller if you don’t know the answer, and offer to take a message (or provide a Pro Staff member’s email address, if appropriate). Be nice! No matter how hungry or tired or grumpy you are, it's important to exhibit a pleasant demeanor while you’re interacting with members.
- If you are busy with a real, live human member when the phone rings, it’s important to attend to that person’s needs before assisting the person on the phone. In this case, after greeting the caller, follow up with “I'm assisting someone at the desk; would you please hold for a minute?" If you know you'll be more than “a minute”, you can ask to take the caller’s phone number and call back, or politely request that they themselves call back in a few minutes.
- When a caller is trying to reach a professional staff member who isn’t in the office at the time of calling, please provide the requested professional staff member’s JHU email address with which the caller may follow up.

Here’s how to handle the most common types of calls:

**The caller who has questions about becoming authorized on equipment**

Let the caller know that they can generally come to the DMC during any of its open hours to have a student staff member authorize them on the desired equipment. If this request comes during a high-traffic time (Friday–Sunday) or for a high-demand piece of equipment (such as an advanced camera), make a reservation for that equipment in the name of the staffer who will be on duty when the patron comes to get authorized. Create an event on the DMCStaff calendar with the patron’s JHED and the equipment name, and invite a Pro Staffer if necessary.

**The caller who wants to make an equipment reservation over the phone:**

Let the caller know that if they are a member, they should be able to and make their own reservations for equipment, spaces, and workshops through BookIt at bookit.dmc.jhu.edu. Student staff shouldn’t make reservations for patrons; all equipment circulation should be patron-initiated.

**The caller who’s seeking general information about the DMC:**

If the person is looking for general information, inform them of our website, http://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/dmc/. Everything you could possibly have to tell them is on this site! Answer any questions you can, but tell the caller if you don’t know an answer, and offer to take a message (or forward the call to a professional staff member, if appropriate).

**The caller who has no idea what they’re doing and called the wrong place:**

Yes, we get ’em. Lots of ’em. Try to find the right place for the caller by using the JHED directory at my.jhu.edu or looking around on the JHU website.

### In-Lab Teaching
As the person ‘running’ the DMC lab, you will be the first one patrons turn to for help with problems ranging from trivial to overwhelming. Patrons enter the lab with a wide range of skills and attitudes. Your job is to help them accomplish their goals, sometimes despite themselves.

When faced with many patrons who require your assistance, try to use a ‘triage’ approach – that is, put the most resources where they will be of best effect. You simply won’t be able to hand hold a neophyte through a first encounter with Photoshop if folks are lined up at the Front Desk. Likewise, an experienced lab user may have a question which is simply beyond your knowledge. You should feel comfortable telling folks:

> “Now is not a great time for me to help you with this – if you’d like to make an appointment to learn how to use this application, I’d be happy to give you our Multimedia Specialist’s card, and you contact them or schedule an appointment with them via HopkinsGroups”

or

> “I’m sorry, I don’t know how to do this, but if you’d like to leave a message for our Specialist, I’ll bet they’ll be able to help you".

When teaching someone how to use a new application or tool, here are some tips to keep in mind:
1.	Try to get a good idea of what the learner already knows and what they don’t, so you can approach the teaching at the right level.
2.	Whenever possible, go with the person to the computer rather than just giving instructions from the Front Desk.
3.	The ‘triage’ approach works at an individual level as well – you may not be able to address all of the student’s needs, so determine how you can best be of assistance.
4.	Let the learner keep their hand on the mouse and direct them where to click; many people will learn better when they are active participants.
5.	Don’t overwhelm learners. Teach them the minimum they need to get the specific job done, then suggest other ways to continue the learning process at another time such as a workshop or LinkedIn Learning.
6.	“Give a man a fish; you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime.” Teach learners how to do it, don’t do it for them.
7.	Keep technical terms to a minimum and if you must use them, define them.
8.	“Trial and error” is a valid learning process, if you kind of know how to accomplish a task but don’t know the specifics. Explore different options with the patron and figure it out together. Try to encourage the learner to 'stick with it' and to budget enough time to master the skills.
9.	Identify ways learners can find answers to their own questions. Work with learners to find the answer to their questions using online help or paper-based documentation. Remember that the DMC website has a lot of internally-created guides and links to external learning resources.
10.	Assist learners with identification of synonyms to use as search terms if they are unable to find documentation on what they wish to do.

### Other Tasks

Aside from answering the phone and helping patrons with check outs and returns, tasks for Front Desk Shifts include:

1.	Announcing your arrival to the Front Desk staffer you are relieving. 
2.	Reviewing any outstanding business with Front Desk staffer you are relieving and read any notes left for you. 
3.	Hanging your staff photo on the Front Desk station.
4.	Logging into the front desk computer and monitoring Discord, BookIt, RealVNC, and dmcstaff@jhu.edu mailbox
5.	Checking for overdue items in BookIt – are they returned?
6.	Attending to any DMC business left at the Front Desk (equipment needing to be put away, creating tickets for issues left, etc).
7.  Completing open Circulation Tickets or tickets assigned specifically to you.
8.	Asking a Pro Staffer if there are any tasks that need doing during the shift.
