# JHU Student Employment

You are a human being first, JHU student second, and DMC Student Staff third. Please prioritize your health and well-being and academics above your DMC responsibilities: if needed, feel free to get coverage for a shift and contact Pro Staff for any situation.

The DMC is committed to the full development of our student employees, and to providing a safe, pleasant, nurturing work environment. If you have any questions, problems, concerns, or suggestions related to your employment, please try to talk with Professional Staff at any time. The DMC follows Johns Hopkins HR and employment policies. 


- Questions about schedules and timecards can be addressed to the DMC Program Coordinator or other professional staff.
- Questions about payment, tax documents or check address can be addressed by [University Experiential Learning](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/studentemployment/). stujob@jhu.edu | 410-516-8400

JHU-wide HR policies may be found [here.](https://hr.jhu.edu/working-here/university-policies/)

## Schedule

The Program Coordinator will try develop a schedule that is most convenient to the greatest number of StuStaff members. The schedules are as follows:

•	**Interim** - A schedule for the first few weeks of a semester allowing for training of new staff and flexibility during the course add/drop period

•	**Regular** - A fixed schedule of staffing from noon-midnight Sunday through Thursday and noon to 7 pm Friday and Saturday. If needed, a 7-10pm shift on Friday and Saturday nights will rotate among all StuStaff members.

•	**Vacation / Intersession / Summer** - A schedule for people who elect to stay on or near campus during a school vacation (such as Orientation, Thanksgiving Week, Spring Break, post-finals, summer, etc.) Schedule will be based on staff availability with a goal of staying open noon to 5pm on three days, noon to 8pm on two days, and several hours on one weekend day.

Every effort will be made to accommodate each employee’s course schedule and personal preferences when assigning work hours. Once the schedule is set and you have accepted certain hours, you will be expected to show up reliably and promptly for each shift. Please be considerate of your fellow employees and arrive on time for work.

## Attendance Policy
Staff coverage of the lab during all posted hours is essential, and the DMC relies on Front Desk staff to provide that coverage, particularly on evenings and weekends. If you must miss a shift, it is your responsibility to find another Student Staffer who can cover for you. This is best accomplished by:

1.	Inform all Professional Staff in advance via email or [#sub-requests](https://discord.com/channels/676219251148980240/813177344445382707) on Discord which shift you cannot work.
2.	Offer or swap your shift on Teams. 
3.	Send the person covering for you a reminder email the day before the shift so that they don't forget. 
4.	Professional Staff must approve schedule changes in Shifts, so if the change does not show up in the application, contact Pro Staff immediately. *Your shift is not considered "covered" until it is approved in Shifts!*

***If you are truly unable to find coverage you must notify Pro Staff no later than 24 hours in advance of the shift so that other arrangements can be made. If your shift falls on a weekend please notify ProStaff by 5 PM the Friday before.***

If you are unable to find a sub, if you are seriously sick, or if there is an emergency that prevents you from coming to work or finding a sub, inform all Pro Staff ASAP by phone (call the DMC during office hours or cell phones off hours).

Remember, you have accepted the responsibility of working at the DMC. This means other interests take a backseat to your assigned shifts. You will not be required to work during classes or other academic obligations, but unexpected non-academic events may have to be missed if you cannot find a sub for your DMC shift. Request coverage as soon as you know you have a conflict with another event.

## Group and One-on-One Meetings
From time to time, the entire staff or a subgroup will meet for operational or social reasons. We currently hold mandatory all-staff training twice per year, multiple drop-in 'refresher' trainings, a staff development event in mid-fall, a winter holiday party at the end of the Fall semester, and an end-of-year party at the end of the Spring semester. We also require Student Staff to attend at least one workshop in each category each semester. Other meetings may be held as necessary. You will get paid for all your required trainings and meetings, including staff development and workshops.

Each Student Staffer will meet once a semester with the Pro Staff to review the employee’s performance and discuss opportunities for further training or changes in duties. In addition, all ProStaff are willing and eager to meet with Student Staff at any time to discuss concerns, questions, or suggestions.

## Maryland Sick and Safe Leave
Eligible staff and students earn 1 hour of Maryland Sick and Safe Leave (MDSS) for every 30 hours worked up to a maximum of 80 hours per fiscal year (July 1 – June 30). The leave is protected and must be granted if accrued sick leave is available at the time of the request.

To request MDSS, contact Pro Staff directly (to protect your privacy, don't post on Discord).

To be eligible for paid MDSS, the hourly paid staff or student: 

- Must be employed for at least 90 calendar days 
- Must average at least 8 hours of work per week 
- Must work in the State of Maryland 

Covered dependents: 

- Self 
- Immediate family members 
- Extended family members 

Covered reasons: 

- Treatment or care for a mental or physical illness, injury, or condition 
- Preventative medical care 
- Maternity or paternity leave 
- Leave that is necessary due to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking or the need to relocate or receive services. 
- Public health emergency

## Discipline and Termination
### Fireable Offenses

Fireable Offenses are 5 infractions that can automatically result in termination.

Examples of Fireable Offenses include, but are not limited to:

1.	Leaving the lab unsecured (door unlocked or windows open) when closing
2.	Leaving the lab unattended with patrons inside
3.	Giving people your special access to the DMC without accompanying them
4.	Staying in the DMC after midnight
5.	Engaging in or furthering unauthorized use of DMC resources

### Major Offenses
Multiple Minor Offenses or serious infractions will result in written and in-person warnings, and a pattern of behavior may be considered a Major Offense. Following a written warning, termination may occur if corrective action is not taken or a second Major Offense occurs. 

Examples include, but are not limited to:
1.	Missing a shift without warning
2.	Closing the lab without Pro Staff approval
3.	Allowing unauthorized users to use the lab or borrow equipment
4.	Improper checkout or check-in procedures
5.	Leaving the cage or circulation room unsecured when open
6.	Allowing patrons into the cage
7.	Violation of DMC or University Policies

### Minor Offenses
Minor infractions of the rules governing employment at the DMC will result in a verbal or written warning, which will be made in person and/or via e-mail. The warning will state the infraction and will specify corrective action to be taken by the employee.

Examples of Minor Offenses include, but are not limited to:
1.	Lateness for shift, without warning
2.	Non-responsiveness to email or phone calls from Pro Sstaff
3.	Inability or unwillingness to be proactive and engaging with lab members
4.	Ignoring daily tasks in order to pursue personal interests while working
5.	Inappropriate dress or behavior in the lab
6.	Eating in the lab (food is OK at the Front Desk)
7.	Playing loud or inappropriate music, or otherwise contributing to a non-professional atmosphere in the lab
8.	Having non-staff friends behind front desk and or focusing on friends over work during shifts

### Termination
Notification of termination will occur in person (if possible) and will be followed up in writing via email or US mail. Upon termination all keys and DMC property must be returned immediately, and any outstanding fines paid before the end of the semester. Failure to return property or pay fines will result in notification to the Dean of Student Life, and may result in withheld grades or delayed graduation. 

After termination, all DMC Student Staff privileges will be revoked. 

## Time and Pay Systems
All student employees of the university, whether receiving Federal Work Study (FWS) or not, are paid through the schools’s central payroll system. 

The DMC utilizes a timecard system for all student employment including Front Desk shifts, lab coaching, Project Ssifts, and time spent on paid training, special projects, and events. You will receive a weekly email reminding you to submit your time, usually on Mondays. 

Although timecards are kept and hours are logged on a weekly basis, all student employees are paid semi-monthly (once in the middle and once at the end of the month). This occasionally leads to confusion about when a particular set of hours worked will result in an actual paycheck. You can find the payroll schedule posted on the wall in the break room. 

We strongly urge you to sign up for direct deposit through ESS, as this results in timely, efficient automatic deposit of your pay directly into your bank account. *Bonus: direct deposits appear one workday before paper checks!*

### ESS
[Employee Self Service](https://ess.johnshopkins.edu/) (ESS) is an enhancement to the central HR/Payroll system that will allow you to view your personal and payroll data and easily make changes. Log on using your JHED ID. Check the [ESS Quick Reference Guide](https://hrpayroll.ssc.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/ESSCueCard.pdf).

### TimesheetX
TimesheetX is the system JHU uses to track your time on a weekly basis. Refer to the [TimesheetX Guide for Student Employees](https://studentjob.jh.edu/seoform/timesheetx/TSX_Training_Guide_for_Students.pdf) for more information.

### Shifts in Teams
Shifts is an app within Teams that will record all your scheduled shifts and sick time. See [Get Started in Shifts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-in-shifts-5f3e30d8-1821-4904-be26-c3cd25a497d6) for more information.
