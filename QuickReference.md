# Quick Reference for DMC Staff

## Hours & Location
During Fall and Spring semester, we're open Monday-Friday 12 PM – 12 AM. The Gaming Loft is open 4 PM – 12 AM, 7 days a week (subject to change from LEED office who staffs the LaB).
[BookIt](http://bookit.dmc.jhu.edu) will always have our most up-to-date hours.

We're located at **3003 N Charles St., Baltimore, MD 21218.** This is the same address as many other offices in this block which can be confusing. When wayfinding on the phone or email:
- We're located right next to FedEx. Go under the "Hopkins Square" archway and down the stairs and our front door is to the right.
- Our south entrance is also on Charles Street, in the next courtyard over. This is our ADA-accessible entrance.
